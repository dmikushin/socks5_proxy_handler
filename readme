sending and receiving message blocks/TCP stream over SOCKS5 proxy (running locally or through network) with UNIX sockets is a pain, 
I implemented this because I was frustrated myself trying to send TCP stream through a SOCKS5 server, so I implemented an abstraction
over UNIX sockets for this `specific` purpose. The interface is super easy to use and you just need to link `SOCKS5_proxy_handle.cpp`
during compilation.

Checkout `test.cpp` for the examples on how to use it.

(Im planning to add more things soon...)
